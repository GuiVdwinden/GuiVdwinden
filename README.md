End of 2020, I got a crush on coding!
It hit me when I did my first â€˜forâ€™ loop on a free Python introduction class. 3 months and a Data Science bootcamp later, having cleaned tons of dataframes and trained my first keras models, Iâ€™m equipped with plenty of exciting tools to play with and ready to have an impact in my areas of interest (sustainability, circular economy, decarbonization).

After 7 stimulating years spent in Corporate Finance, supporting the distribution of vaccines worldwide and developing my project management skills, I felt I needed to take a turn.
And my master in Environmental Management has strengthened my will to make my actions count.

Skills: PYTHON / SQL / PANDAS / NUMPY / SCIKIT-LEARN / KERAS-TENSORFLOW
