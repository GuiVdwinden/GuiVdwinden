End of 2020, I got a crush on coding! It hit me when I did my first â€˜forâ€™ loop on a free Python introduction class. After 7 stimulating years spent in Corporate Finance, supporting the distribution of vaccines worldwide and developing my project management skills, I felt I needed to take a turn. And my master in Environmental Management has strengthened my will to make my actions count.

Flash forward, having completed a first professional experience as a **Data Scientist** and having worked with remote sensing data, I'm now teaching at Le Wagon and focusing on creating impact in my areas of interest (climate, circular economy, decarbonization).


Skills: PYTHON / PANDAS / NUMPY / SCIKIT-LEARN / KERAS-TENSORFLOW / REMOTE SENSING
