### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Guillaume

![I'm passionate about how Data Science can be leveraged in the fight against climate change.](https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/2020-11/earth-space-lights-banner.jpg)

Still amazed by what a few lines of code applied to satellite data can achieve. I dedicate my energy and skills (remote sensing, data science) to develop climate-smart applications for better decision making.

Having started my career in the field of finance within multinational company, my master in Environmental Management then pushed me to join, at my level, the battle against climate change. 

PYTHON: pandas, numpy   
ML/DL: scikit-learn, keras-tensorflow, pytorch  
REMOTE SENSING: geopandas, rasterio, xarray  
ML OPS: gcp, docker
